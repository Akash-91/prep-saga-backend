HOW TO RUN IT
Now that you have your Dockerfile, env, and everything ready, follow this exact sequence:

1. 🧹 Clean previous builds (Optional but good):
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
   docker system prune -f
2. 🏗️ Build everything
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   docker compose build
3. 🚀 Run all services
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   docker compose up -d
4. 🔍 See container logs
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   docker compose logs -f
   You can also check individual container logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs <container_name>
# example:
docker logs prepsaga-backend-1
✅ VERIFYING IT WORKS
Item	How to Check
🔁 Backend	http://localhost:8082/api/hello or login endpoint
🌐 Frontend	http://localhost:3000
🗄️ Postgres	psql -h localhost -U postgres -d prepsaga
📦 Containers Running	docker ps
🐳 Volume Persisting?	docker volume ls and docker volume inspect pgdata

🧪 Troubleshooting Tips
Symptom	Fix
Backend cannot connect to DB	Check JDBC URL and DB credentials
React frontend cannot talk to backend	Check CORS settings, correct backend URL in .env, rebuild React
React 404 on refresh	Consider serving via Nginx or set homepage in package.json if using React Router
Build stuck on npm install	Ensure node_modules isn’t copied during build (use .dockerignore)

🔁 Restart if Needed
bash
Copy
Edit
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
If everything is right, your app should now be available at:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:8082

Let me know if you want to:

Set up Nginx as reverse proxy

Add production profile switch

Connect this to Azure Postgres or AKS

Ready for the next step when you are ✅
